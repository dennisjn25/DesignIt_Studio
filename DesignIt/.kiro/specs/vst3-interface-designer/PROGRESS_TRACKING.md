# VST3 Interface Designer - Progress Tracking System

## Overview

This automated progress tracking system monitors the development progress of the VST3 Interface Designer project and updates every 5 minutes. It tracks task completion, milestones, time estimates, and provides both file-based and web-based dashboards.

## Features

- ✅ **Automated Updates**: Scans tasks.md every 5 minutes for changes
- 📊 **Progress Analytics**: Tracks completion rates, time estimates, and milestones
- 🎯 **Milestone Tracking**: Groups tasks into logical development phases
- 📈 **Historical Data**: Maintains progress history in JSON format
- 🌐 **Web Dashboard**: Beautiful HTML dashboard for visual progress monitoring
- 📝 **Detailed Reports**: Comprehensive markdown reports with task details

## Quick Start

### Windows

```bash
# Double-click or run from command line
start-tracker.bat
```

### macOS/Linux

```bash
# Make executable and run
chmod +x start-tracker.sh
./start-tracker.sh
```

### Manual Start

```bash
cd scripts
node progress-updater.js
```

## Files Structure

```

```

## How It Works

### 1. Task Status Detection

The system parses `tasks.md` and detects task status based on checkbox format:

- `- [ ]` = Not Started
- `- [-]` = In Progress  
- `- [x]` = Completed
- `- [!]` = Blocked (custom status)

### 2. Progress Calculation

- **Overall Progress**: Percentage of completed tasks
- **Milestone Progress**: Progress within each development phase
- **Time Tracking**: Estimated vs actual hours (when logged)

### 3. Automated Updates

Every 5 minutes, the system:

1. Scans the tasks.md file for changes
2. Calculates new progress metrics
3. Updates progress-tracker.md with latest data
4. Logs progress history to progress-log.json
5. Displays update confirmation in console

## Milestones

The project is divided into 6 major milestones:

1. **Foundation & Core Engine** (Tasks 1-6) - Week 2
   - Project setup, canvas engine, basic components

2. **Component System & UI** (Tasks 7-12) - Week 4
   - Component library, project management, authentication

3. **AI Integration & Templates** (Tasks 13-18) - Week 6
   - AI assistant, templates, preview system, export engine

4. **Advanced Features** (Tasks 19-24) - Week 8
   - Desktop app, animations, collaboration, responsive design

5. **Character System & ML** (Tasks 25-28) - Week 10
   - Character design, ML intelligence, advanced export

6. **Testing & Deployment** (Tasks 29-32) - Week 12
   - Testing suite, documentation, deployment

## Web Dashboard

Open `progress-dashboard.html` in any modern web browser to view:

- 📊 Real-time progress statistics
- 🎯 Milestone completion status
- 📈 Visual progress bars
- 🔄 Auto-refresh every 5 minutes
- 📱 Responsive design for mobile/desktop

## Customization

### Adding Custom Task Statuses

Edit the `taskStatuses` object in `progress-updater.js`:

```javascript
this.taskStatuses = {
  'not_started': 'Not Started',
  'in_progress': 'In Progress', 
  'completed': 'Completed',
  'blocked': 'Blocked',
  'review': 'Under Review'  // Custom status
};
```

### Modifying Update Interval

Change the interval in `progress-updater.js`:

```javascript
// Update every 10 minutes instead of 5
setInterval(() => {
  this.run();
}, 10 * 60 * 1000);
```

### Custom Time Estimates

Update the `getEstimatedHours()` method with your own estimates:

```javascript
getEstimatedHours(taskNumber) {
  const estimates = {
    1: 12,  // Increased from 8 hours
    2: 16,  // Increased from 12 hours
    // ... etc
  };
  return estimates[taskNumber] || 8;
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Script won't start:**

- Ensure Node.js is installed (`node --version`)
- Check file permissions on Unix systems (`chmod +x start-tracker.sh`)
- Verify you're in the correct directory

**Progress not updating:**

- Check that tasks.md exists and is properly formatted
- Ensure the script has write permissions for the directory
- Look for error messages in the console output

**Dashboard not loading:**

- Open progress-dashboard.html directly in a web browser
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure the HTML file is in the correct location

### Debug Mode

Run with additional logging:

```bash
cd scripts
DEBUG=1 node progress-updater.js
```

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Git Hooks

Add to `.git/hooks/post-commit` to update progress after commits:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd .kiro/specs/vst3-interface-designer/scripts
node progress-updater.js
```

### CI/CD Integration

Include in your build pipeline:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Update Progress
  run: |
    cd .kiro/specs/vst3-interface-designer/scripts
    node progress-updater.js
```

### IDE Integration

Many IDEs can run the script as a background task or integrate with the file watcher.

## Data Export

Progress data is stored in JSON format and can be exported for:

- 📊 External analytics tools
- 📈 Project management software
- 📋 Status reports
- 📊 Time tracking applications

## Support

For issues or feature requests:

1. Check the console output for error messages
2. Verify Node.js version compatibility (requires Node.js 14+)
3. Ensure proper file permissions and directory structure
4. Review this documentation for configuration options
