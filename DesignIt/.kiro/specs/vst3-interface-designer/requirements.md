# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The VST3 Interface Designer is a cross-platform visual design application available as both a desktop application and web application that enables musicians, producers, and plugin developers to create professional VST3 plugin interfaces through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. The application combines the creative power of AI-assisted design with the precision of professional interface development, allowing users to create state-of-the-art plugin interfaces that can be exported for use in development environments like Kiro or Cursor.

The application serves as an "AI Photoshop for VST plugins," providing both novice and expert users with the tools to create visually stunning, functionally robust plugin interfaces without requiring deep programming knowledge. Users can choose between the web version for quick access and collaboration, or the desktop version for enhanced performance and offline capabilities.
