# VST3 Interface Designer - Project Overview

## Project Status

This project is currently in the **specification and planning phase**. The core requirements, design architecture, and implementation tasks have been defined, but no source code has been written yet. The project is ready to begin implementation.

## What This Project Is

The VST3 Interface Designer is a cross-platform visual design application that enables musicians, producers, and plugin developers to create professional VST3 plugin interfaces through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. It serves as an "AI Photoshop for VST plugins," combining creative AI-assisted design with professional interface development precision.

## Key Features to Implement

- **Visual Drag-and-Drop Interface Creation**: Professional interface design without complex UI coding
- **Comprehensive VST3 Component Library**: Industry-standard controls (knobs, sliders, buttons, displays)
- **AI-Powered Design Assistance**: Intelligent suggestions, auto-arrangement, and requirements-based generation
- **Multi-Format Code Export**: Generate code for JUCE, iPlug2, and other frameworks
- **Cross-Platform Deployment**: Available as both web application and desktop application
- **Professional Design Generation**: Industry-inspired layouts and patterns
- **Creative Shell Design**: Custom plugin frames and window decorations
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Team-based design with version control

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript, React-Konva for canvas operations
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Framer Motion for animations
- **Desktop**: Electron for cross-platform deployment
- **Canvas**: Konva.js for 2D graphics and shape manipulation
- **State Management**: Zustand with React Query for server state
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth 2.0 with Google Drive API integration
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API for design suggestions and automated layout
- **Build System**: Vite with TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier
